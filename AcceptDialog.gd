# Let us state this algorithm in the form of a program, written in a general ‚Äúpseudocode‚Äù

# tion, the same letter M = (mij ) will be used to denote the current augmented matrix at
# each stage in the computation, keeping in mind that its entries will change as the algorithm
# progresses. We initialize M = A | b . The final
